# Docker From Scratch

docker from scratch following the codecrafters challenge, this is an educational project intended to better understand C and how docker works.

## Notes

### On Stage 1 and 2

- code worked with little modification but this was a
  quirk of the testing and not intended.

- It took me a long time to understand the execv command,
  images and pipes, specifically stderr and stdout.

### Stage 3

- This one took a while and I think a C programmer would have done it in 5 mins.
  In the end I had to look up the solution, I nearly
  had the answer but failed to return the correct
  value at the end of the if statement.

### Stage 4

- Im really struggling now and get the feeling
  a C developer would have no issues here.
  In the end I had to use one of the examples provided
  I tried using the command line tools like.
  cp and mkdir but It wasnt giving the expected
  output for the tests.

- In the end I get the feeling, for me at least
  this would be much easier to do in a bash script
  using command line tools. This is probably
  due to my lack of familiarity with
  C unix programming.

- overall as much as im learning here
  much of it is just a respect for C programming
  I can see clearly the gulp in my understanding
  and what is required to be proficient.

- I also get the feeling this is a simply task
  in C, just spawning a process, attaching pipes,
  making it secure chroot. I know this would be
  very straight forward to accomplish in bash
