# Docker From Scratch

docker from scratch following the codecrafters challenge, this is an educational project intended to better understand C and how docker works.

## Notes

### On Stage 1 and 2

- code worked with little modification but this was a
  quirk of the testing and not intended.

- It took me a long time to understand the execv command,
  images and pipes, specifically stderr and stdout.

### Stage 3

- This one took a while and I think a C programmer would have done it in 5 mins.
  In the end I had to look up the solution, I nearly
  had the answer but failed to return the correct
  value at the end of the if statement.
